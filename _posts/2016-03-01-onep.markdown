Here's another attempt at looking at the ultra-wealthy in Vancouver, with the demographics of the 1%. Somewhat predictably, the biggest growth of people in the top 1% of income has been in Calgary and Edmonton.

* * *

<div class="onepTitle">Demographic change of the 1% in Canadian cities</div>
<div class="onepSubTitle">After tax income with capital gains</div>

<div id="onepChart" class="chart"></div>
<div id="onepTip" class="hidden">
	<p class="tipTitle"><span id="onepName"></span></p>
	<p class="tipInfo"><span id="onepVal"></span></p>
	<p class="tipInfo"><span id="onepAvg"></span></p>
</div>

* * *

So again, Vancouver doesn't look especially exceptional when it comes to the super-rich when compared to other parts of Canada. The growth has been virtually identical to Toronto.
