You may have noticed in [yesterday's post]({% post_url 2015-10-23-unhcr-refugee %}) there were many developed countries that refugees were coming from. Well guess what, there are refugees from Canada too. While Canada is hardly a major origin of refugees, they apparently do exist according to the UNHCR. As far as I can tell, these are people who somehow did fall under the definition of refugee or were in a refugee-like situation. But I have no idea how that was determined, or why so many of them are going to Germany.
