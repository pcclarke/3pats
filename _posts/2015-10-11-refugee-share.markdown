If Canada isn't taking in refugees from Syria, where are we taking them in from? Unfortunately, the answer isn't easy to find. Citizenship and Immigration aggregates refugees' origin into regions, rather than by specific countries.

  <p id="tipTop"><span id="tipRegion"></span></p>
</div>
<div id="shareChart"></div>

On the surface, at least, it appears that we're taking in a lot more refugees from Africa and the Middle East.
