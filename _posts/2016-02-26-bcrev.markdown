Okay, one last post on MSP premiums. I swear. I really mean it this time.

While just about every other form of revenue has had swings up and down over the past decade, MSP revenues have grown at a remarkably steady rate:

* * *

<div class="bcrevTitle">Yearly change in BC government revenues</div>

<div id="bcrevChart" class="chart"></div>
<div id="bcrevTip" class="hidden">
	<p class="tipTitle"><span id="bcrevName"></span></p>
	<p class="tipInfo"><span id="bcrevVal"></span></p>
</div>

* * *

I suspect this is a product of the MSP's "unfairness". Unlike income taxes, corporate taxes, or resource revenue, MSP premiums don't go down along with economic downturns and decreased income. They increase along with population growth.

I wonder why the BC government would want to tamper with them at all, given how much they're making off the old scheme?
