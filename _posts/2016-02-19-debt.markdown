[While the deficit may have shrunk]({% post_url 2016-02-17-bcbud %}), the debt in the last BC budget grew. Confused? Me too.

This was inspired by [Vaughn Palmer's column on this seeming contradiction](http://www.vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/vaughn+palmer+back+black+still/11728884/story.html), which explained it to me, although I'm still not convinced it's good governance.
